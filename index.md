## About Me

I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of ISE](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn), [SYSU](https://www.sysu.edu.cn). I currently conduct research in the interdisciplinary field of information science. From 2022 to 2023, I had the honor to conduct scientific research and study in [Prof. Calvin Yu-Chian Chen (é™ˆè¯­è°¦)](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1053/2659.htm)(Director of AI for Science (AI4S) at Peking University)â€™s laboratory, YCLab. From 2024 to 2025, I had the honor to complete my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Yunong Zhang(å¼ é›¨æµ“)](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher01/1416605.htm) (IEEE Member), and conducted research in neurodynamics and robotics in his laboratory. I will receive the Bachelor of Engineering degree from Sun Yat-sen University in June 2025.
